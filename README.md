   ```

## üíª **Usage**

### 1. Run the Script:
- Double-click on `script.bat` to run. The script will automatically request administrative privileges if needed, so you no longer need to manually select "Run as Administrator."
- If prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Yes to grant the necessary permissions.
- Once elevated, the script will continue running with the appropriate permissions for file operations.

### 2. Follow the On-Screen Instructions:
- Choose an option from the menu:
- `1` to activate Adobe Acrobat Pro Activator.
- `2` to exit.
- If you select 1, the script will decode the Base64 encoded files, copy them to the appropriate directory, and provide feedback on the operation status.

## ‚úÖ **Troubleshooting**

- **Administrative Privileges**: If the script does not prompt for administrative rights, ensure you are running it with the required permissions by right-clicking and selecting Run as Administrator.
- **File Paths**: Verify that the encoded.txt , encoded_2.txt files and ASCII_art.txt are correctly placed in the src directory.
- **Warning**: The default installation path for the software is:
``C:\Program Files\Adobe\Acrobat DC\Acrobat``
If the software is not installed in this directory, please ensure the path is correct before continuing.
